# Wielder Ecosystem Guidelines

The fundamental architectural principle behind the Wielder `ecosystem` framework is to actively facilitate **multi-cloud and multi-surface topologies**. Execution paths natively span across disparate infrastructural foundations without modifying the core business logic.

In Wielder, the primary managed noun remains `app`, not `deployment`. An ecosystem phenotypes apps across surfaces and dependencies. Deployment is one operational expression of an app inside that topology, not the whole identity of the configured unit.

### 1. The Multi-Surface Abstraction
Wielder never forces operations to be localized exclusively to one cloud provider or physical machine natively. "Ecosystems" fundamentally decouple the source execution environment (e.g., `local_wsl`, `workstation_mac`) from the target operational endpoints (e.g., `Google Workspace`, `AWS S3`, `GCP Storage`). 
- **Guideline:** Pipelines and central provisioners MUST actively trace and report explicitly which surface is invoking the logic, and which remote surface is catching the payload. 
- **Guideline:** Logging must rigorously reflect structural cross-surface bounds natively: e.g. `[workstation_wsl => Google Workspace] Provisioning target...`.

### 2. Autonomous Ecosystem Provisioning (The `provision` block)
The `ecosystem` definitions explicitly maintain their own isolated network configurations (e.g., `ecosystem_manifest.conf`) which structurally dictate their target surfaces and foundational boundaries natively.
- **Guideline:** Target deployment keys, dependency paths, and foundational infrastructure variables must be universally aggregated natively inside the explicit `provision` dictionary exactly at the root of the targeted ecosystem configuration mappings. 

### 3. Decoupling Artifact Execution via Bucketeer Maps
The native `ecosystem_map` physically bridges topological environments across network boundaries dynamically eliminating source-code coupling structurally!
- **Guideline:** The system can evaluate local filesystem boundaries natively via `DevBucketeer` locally, and dynamically shift gears exclusively onto `GoogleBucketeer` mapping perfectly to explicit multi-cloud artifact deployments dynamically orchestrating the identical logic across boundaries seamlessly!

### 4. Ecosystem as the Home of Execution Topology
Ecosystems are not merely deployment labels. Their deeper role is to carry the **execution topology** of the workload: which dependencies are local, which are remote services, and which combinations form a hybrid.
- **Guideline:** If an application can satisfy a dependency through multiple modes such as local SDK execution, a direct API call to a colocated service, or a hybrid local/remote arrangement, that choice belongs in the ecosystem layer.
- **Guideline:** `stage_tier` is not the right home for these decisions. `stage_tier` describes deployment maturity (`dev`, `stage`, `prod`), whereas execution topology describes dependency distribution and service access shape.
- **Guideline:** Favor ecosystems to express combinations of surfaces. This includes pure local execution, local microservice execution, and future mixed topologies where one dependency remains local while another resolves against a remote surface.
- **Guideline:** A local-first base ecosystem is valid and often preferable during active development. Additional ecosystems may then layer service-oriented or hybrid variants without forcing application business logic to absorb deployment details.
- **Guideline:** Application code should read the already-resolved topology from the ecosystem configuration and branch at the transport boundary only. Scientific DAG payloads should not be overloaded with infrastructure routing concerns.
- **Guideline:** Ecosystems are one of the main tools for assembling ephemeral super-clusters. They express how real distributed surfaces cooperate during temporary validation or execution environments without requiring a separate workflow species for each cluster shape.

### 5. Workflow Contracts and Ecosystem Ownership
Messaging topics, consumer groups, and similar workflow orchestration contracts should not default to project-global scope.
- **Guideline:** If a workflow currently maps 1:1 to an ecosystem, place its orchestration contract inside that ecosystem.
- **Guideline:** If the same workflow contract must be shared by multiple ecosystems later, promote it into a workflow-level include and let the participating ecosystems inherit it.
- **Guideline:** Do not keep workflow-specific messaging contracts at project root unless they are truly global across the entire project.

### 6. Naming App-Specific Ecosystem Overrides
Cross-project orchestration may need to tell multiple downstream apps which ecosystem they should run under. A generic field name can become ambiguous once one config modulates more than one app.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest using app-specific override names such as `app_ecosystem_mmseqs_sequence_alignment` when a config may route multiple downstream apps.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest avoiding generic names such as `app_ecosystem` in multi-app orchestration layers, because they tend to hide which downstream runtime is being modulated.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest avoiding self-referential assignments where an ecosystem overlay redundantly sets an app-specific ecosystem field to the exact same ecosystem name as the containing overlay, unless that duplication is deliberately carrying review signal.
- **Guideline (No Cross-Ecosystem Band-Aids):** Strongly suggest avoiding app-specific ecosystem overrides as a patch for incomplete concrete ecosystems. If a concrete ecosystem is the bootable runtime, the downstream app should run under that same concrete ecosystem, not be silently redirected into some other local surface just to compensate for a missing port, host, or probe fact.

### 7. Family Ecosystems vs Bootable Runtime Ecosystems
Thin reusable ecosystem families and concrete bootable ecosystems are related, but they are not the same thing.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest treating a shared family ecosystem such as `protenix_binding` as a reusable semantic base first, not as an automatic downstream runtime target.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest using `app_ecosystem_<app_name>` as the explicit bridge when a concrete deploy ecosystem needs to adapt a downstream app onto a different bootable runtime ecosystem.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest avoiding the temptation to point a downstream runtime directly at an abstract family ecosystem unless that family has intentionally been made bootable and verified end to end.
- **Guideline:** When a family ecosystem exists alongside thin concrete ecosystems, strongly suggest keeping the concrete ecosystems responsible for operational facts such as registry authority, kube context, pull behavior, and downstream runtime bridging.
- **Guideline (Complete Bootable Ecosystems):** A concrete bootable ecosystem must be complete for the apps it claims to run. If a concrete ecosystem cannot launch a service end to end without redirecting that service into another concrete ecosystem, then the first ecosystem is incomplete and should be repaired rather than bypassed.
- **Guideline (Operational Facts Stay Local):** In-container bind ports, service hosts, NodePorts, port-forwards, registry authorities, and probe coordinates are operational facts. They must be made explicit inside the concrete bootable ecosystem or the deploy contract around it, not hidden by mixing two concrete ecosystems together.

### 8. Thin Concrete Ecosystems
Once a shared family ecosystem has been extracted, the remaining concrete ecosystems should stay obvious and reviewable.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest consolidating concrete override ecosystems into a single `ecosystem_manifest.conf` when their remaining role is to override a small set of operational facts.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest deleting empty or misleading concrete override fragments once their contents have been centralized, rather than preserving them as ceremonial files.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest keeping deployment-resource ordering and Kubernetes object lists at the deployment layer, not inside ecosystem overlays, even when those ecosystems become very thin.

### 9. Local WSL GPU Cluster Choice
For local WSL development of GPU-bound services, the cluster surface should be chosen with image-ingestion behavior in mind, not only conceptual Kubernetes symmetry.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest avoiding Windows-hosted Docker Desktop plus WSL as the primary GPU container surface for local development. The Windows/WSL hybrid boundary adds failure modes around GPU handoff, storage churn, and virtual disk growth.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest installing Docker and the NVIDIA container stack directly inside the Linux WSL distro through the sanctioned repo scripts rather than relying on the Windows Docker Desktop daemon.
- **Guideline:** The sanctioned local install path is a Linux-side Docker and NVIDIA bootstrap script owned by the runtime toolkit itself, not a Windows-hosted Docker Desktop surface.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest preferring `kind` over `k3d` as the default local Kubernetes surface for GPU-bound, image-heavy iteration on WSL.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest using direct image loading such as `kind load docker-image` for the local loop instead of forcing a registry-mediated hop when the goal is fast local service iteration.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest reserving `k3d` for cases where its built-in registry model is itself under test or when the workload is light enough that the extra push/pull churn is negligible.
- **Guideline:** Treat WSL virtual disk expansion and layer churn as first-class operational constraints. For local GPU work, storage pressure can be the decisive failure mode even when Kubernetes CPU and memory remain mostly idle.
- **Guideline:** Treat deprovisioning on WSL as a two-phase operation: first delete clusters, images, and caches inside Linux, then compact the backing WSL VHDX from Windows if host disk pressure remains high.
- **Guideline:** Strongly suggest using the runtime toolkit's Windows-side WSL compaction helper after heavy Docker churn rather than assuming Linux-side deletion will immediately shrink the host `.vhdx`.
