# Master Personas Index

To enforce strict, modularized Artificial Intelligence constraints and prevent "Builder's Bias" during execution, Starget Data utilizes an **Agentic Adversarial Workflow**. This relies on distinct, non-overlapping Personas that the AI must adopt at explicit boundaries in the DAG execution logic.

## The Personas

1. **[The Architecture Planner](../../personas/wielder/PERSONA_PLANNER.md)**  
   *Role:* The Orchestrator. Evaluates massive monolithic user goals, forces them through the Stepping Stone Parcellization pipeline, and explicitly binds necessary operational Skills (Configurations, Testing Rules) to the downstream execution teams. It does not write logic.

2. **[The Blue Team Builder](../../personas/wielder/PERSONA_PLATFORM_DEVELOPER.md)**  
   *Role:* The pragmatic executioner. Strips away monolithic over-engineering. Guided by strict WET (Write Everything Twice) parameters and PyHocon configs. Never abstracts prematurely.

3. **[The Red Team Skeptic](../../personas/wielder/PERSONA_QA_ARCHITECT.md)**  
   *Role:* The hostile auditor. Possesses zero builder memory. Its sole objective is to dissect git diffs against Starget engineering rules, hunting down hubristic quantitative vocabulary and missing data lake partition logic.

## The Adjudicating Interface

The interactions between these Personas are strictly bound and explicitly sequenced by the interaction loop defined in the overarching workflow engine:
- **[AGENTIC ADVERSARIAL WORKFLOW](../../workflows/adversarial/AGENTIC_ADVERSARIAL_WORKFLOW.md)**: The 6-step loop guiding the transition of state and control between the Builder and the Skeptic.
